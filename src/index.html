                    As business onboarding at Wise (back then TransferWise) proved to be a cumbersome process, we looked for ways to 
                    make things easier for potential customers. In UK we integrated with a business registry API in order to 
                    prefill profile values for the customer. Based on the existing frontend it was my task to find an API provider 
                    for US business registries and integrate their API into an existing Java project that already had an integration with the 
                    UK business registry provider. As my first task at Wise I had to find and get an agreement with the vendor, analyze 
                    available data via API, integrate with it and customize frontend to ask for state input. I also monitored the onboarding 
                    metrics via MixPanel to understand the impact of the integration.

                    As my final project as part of my university I set up a boardgame group meetup environment called LikeMinded. 
                    Website's goal was to be a channel for ongoing boardgame news for Estonians and offer an easy way to browse as well 
                    as set up new meetups that fit your gaming taste. Additionally it includes ways to set up groups and find people for 
                    groups. The website has a Spring application running in backend with a Postgres database. Frontend is a React app 
                    written from scratch in Javascript (ES6). Website supports mobile view. As it is currently dormant, the hosting is set up 
                    in Heroku and requires about a minute to bootup after getting a visitor hit.

                  <p class="mb-4">
                    At a point in time, Canada regulatory board made Canadian customer onboarding at online financial institutions very 
                    cumbersome and alternative solutions were investigated. The team found a background check vendor that would allow TransferWise 
                    to automate customer onboarding for customers that have sufficient history with financial instutions in Canada by matching 
                    their exact identity. I was tasked with building a new micro-service to integrate with the vendor, securely store vendor 
                    findings as well as connect with our verification backend services and other backend support tools. I also built out 
                    dashboards in Looker and Grafana to monitor the service and business metrics.
